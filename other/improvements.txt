convert all the 2D arrays that currently store the board contents to simple arrays
sort out the mess with storing the symbols as -1 and 1, versus O and X
X make it tell you which board you are playing in
X teach it that by winning a board it will deny that board to me
teach it to recognize when a board that it is trying to make a line out of is unwinnable
add ability to concentrate on a specific line it wants
X it will block (kindof preventing a win) but this then leads to a win for me
find a way to better allocate processes
X add timeout functionality
  note: severely compromises integrity of desTree, since branches should be the same length to have meaningful comparison between them. Not implemented in main project.
design a benchmark program
Make it able to handle invalid inputs, such as 2,2 rather than 2, 2
